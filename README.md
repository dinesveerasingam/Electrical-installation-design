I designed a building electrical wiring layout in AutoCAD following IEC standards, including voltage drop analysis, cable sizing, load and demand calculations, and protective device selection. The work covered SLD preparation, DB selection, three-phase load balancing, and optimized cable routing for safe, efficient power distribution.

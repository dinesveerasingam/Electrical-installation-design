# Electrical-installation-design
I designed a comprehensive building electrical wiring layout in AutoCAD in full compliance with IEC standards. The work involved performing voltage drop analysis, cable sizing, load and demand calculations, and selecting appropriate protective devices to ensure safe and efficient electrical distribution. I also prepared detailed single-line diagrams and optimized circuit layouts for lighting, socket outlets, and distribution boards. The installation design covered power distribution from the main incomer to all loads, selection of suitable distribution boards, cable sizing based on current-carrying capacity and allowable voltage drop, coordination of protective devices, three-phase load balancing, and planning of socket outlet arrangements with efficient cable routing.
